Colorectal cancer (CRC) is one of the most common and deadly cancers worldwide, with a significant need for new diagnostic and prognostic tools due to its high mortality rates and often late detection. Most CRC cases are sporadic, developing through a combination of genetic mutations and epigenetic alterations—chemical modifications to DNA and chromatin that do not change the DNA sequence itself but can regulate gene expression. These epigenetic factors, such as DNA methylation and histone modifications, play a crucial part in the transformation of normal colon cells into cancerous ones.

 A foundational epigenetic change in CRC is abnormal methylation: both global DNA hypomethylation, which may activate oncogenes, and promoter-specific hypermethylation, which can silence tumor suppressor genes. For example, genes like VIM and SEPT9 are frequently methylated in CRC tissues, making their methylation patterns useful as non-invasive biomarkers that can be detected in blood. Histone modification further contributes to gene silencing, and changes in non-coding RNAs (such as microRNAs and long non-coding RNAs) add an extra layer of regulatory complexity. From a systems biology perspective, CRC development often involves disrupted signaling pathways—such as Wnt, RAS-RAF-MAPK, and p53—due to these genetic and epigenetic alterations. 

 Recent research leverages high-throughput technologies, like RNA sequencing, to profile RNA expression changes across thousands of genes. This helps identify those that are differentially expressed in cancer compared to normal tissue, offering new candidates for diagnostic and therapeutic biomarkers.
