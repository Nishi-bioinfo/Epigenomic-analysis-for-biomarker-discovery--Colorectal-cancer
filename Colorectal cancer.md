# Colorectal Cancer: Molecular and Epigenetic Basis for Biomarker Discovery

## Overview

**Colorectal cancer (CRC)** is one of the most prevalent and deadly cancers worldwide. Despite advances in treatment, CRC continues to have a high mortality rate, largely due to **late-stage diagnosis**. This highlights a critical need for **reliable diagnostic and prognostic biomarkers** that enable early detection and guide personalized treatment strategies.

Most CRC cases are **sporadic**, arising from a complex interplay of **genetic mutations** and **epigenetic alterations**. While genetic mutations directly change the DNA sequence, epigenetic modifications regulate gene expression without altering the underlying DNA. Together, these molecular events drive the transformation of normal colonic epithelial cells into malignant tumors.

This project establishes a **genomic analysis foundation** for colorectal cancer biomarker discovery, while positioning epigenomic and transcriptomic mechanisms as essential biological context and future integration layers.

## Role of Epigenetics in Colorectal Cancer

Epigenetic regulation plays a central role in CRC biology and provides critical insight for biomarker development. Major epigenetic mechanisms involved include:

- **DNA methylation**
- **Histone modifications**
- **Non-coding RNA regulation**

A hallmark epigenetic feature of CRC is **aberrant DNA methylation**, which occurs in two major forms:

1. **Global DNA hypomethylation**  
   - Leads to genomic instability  
   - May activate oncogenes  

2. **Promoter-specific hypermethylation**  
   - Silences tumor suppressor genes  
   - Contributes to tumor initiation and progression  

Several genes, such as **VIM (Vimentin)** and **SEPT9**, are frequently hypermethylated in CRC tissues. Importantly, these methylation patterns can be detected in circulating DNA from blood samples, making them valuable **non-invasive biomarkers** for CRC screening.

## Additional Epigenetic Layers

Beyond DNA methylation, CRC development is influenced by multiple epigenetic regulatory layers:

- **Histone modifications**  
  These alter chromatin structure and regulate long-term gene activation or repression.

- **Non-coding RNAs**  
  Including:
  - MicroRNAs (miRNAs)
  - Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs)  

  These molecules fine-tune gene expression and are frequently dysregulated in CRC, contributing to tumor growth, invasion, and metastasis.

## Disrupted Signaling Pathways

From a systems biology perspective, CRC progression involves disruption of key cellular signaling pathways, including:

- **Wnt/β-catenin**
- **RAS–RAF–MAPK**
- **p53 tumor suppressor pathway**

Both genetic mutations (such as **KRAS**) and epigenetic alterations converge on these pathways, driving uncontrolled cell proliferation, impaired apoptosis, and therapeutic resistance.

## High-Throughput Technologies and Biomarker Discovery

High-throughput sequencing technologies have transformed CRC research by enabling large-scale molecular profiling. In particular:

- **Whole-exome sequencing (WES)** enables systematic identification of cancer-associated genetic variants.
- **RNA sequencing (RNA-seq)** and epigenomic profiling provide complementary insights into gene expression changes and regulatory mechanisms.

In this project, **WES-based variant discovery** serves as the **primary implemented methodology**, generating high-confidence genomic variants that form the basis for biomarker identification. Transcriptomic and epigenomic analyses are considered **biological context and future integration opportunities** that can further refine biomarker interpretation.

## Conclusion

Modern colorectal cancer research increasingly relies on the **integration of genomic, epigenomic, and transcriptomic information** to identify robust and clinically relevant biomarkers.

This project contributes to that goal by establishing a **reproducible genomic analysis pipeline** for colorectal cancer variant discovery, while situating epigenetic and RNA-based mechanisms as critical complementary layers for future multi-omics integration.

Such integrative molecular approaches are essential for:

- Early cancer detection  
- Prognostic prediction  
- Personalized therapeutic targeting  

Ultimately, this framework supports improved clinical outcomes and advances precision medicine strategies for **CRC patients**.
