The key pathways involved in colorectal cancer include:

* Wnt/β-catenin pathway: Critical in tumor initiation, promoting uncontrolled cell growth—often activated by early APC mutations.
* MAPK/ERK pathway (RAS-RAF-MEK-ERK): Promotes proliferation and survival, commonly activated by KRAS or BRAF mutations
* PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway: Enhances cell growth, metabolism, and survival, activated by mutations in PIK3CA and others.
* TGF-β/SMAD pathway: Regulates cell differentiation and apoptosis; acts as a tumor suppressor early but can promote invasion/metastasis at later stages (mutations in SMAD4, TGFBR2).
* DNA Mismatch Repair (MMR)/Microsatellite Instability (MSI) pathway: Involves MSH2, MSH6, MLH1, PMS2 for genomic stability—defects lead to MSI, a hallmark in many CRCs.
* Notch and JAK/STAT pathways: Play supporting roles in cell fate, immune response, and tumor microenvironment regulation.

These pathways interact and cross-regulate, driving the multistep progression from normal colonic epithelium to metastatic colorectal cancer.
