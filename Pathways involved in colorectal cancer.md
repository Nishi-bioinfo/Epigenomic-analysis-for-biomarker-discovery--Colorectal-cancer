## Key Molecular Pathways in Colorectal Cancer

Colorectal cancer progression is driven by the cumulative disruption of multiple, interconnected signaling pathways that regulate cell proliferation, differentiation, survival, and genomic stability. Genetic alterations identified through whole-exome sequencing (WES), including mutations in **KRAS**, **APC**, **TP53**, and related genes, converge on these pathways to promote tumor development and progression.

### Wnt/β-catenin Pathway
The **Wnt/β-catenin pathway** plays a critical role in **tumor initiation** in colorectal cancer. Early loss-of-function mutations in the **APC** tumor suppressor gene result in constitutive activation of β-catenin signaling, leading to uncontrolled cell proliferation and adenoma formation.

### MAPK/ERK Pathway (RAS–RAF–MEK–ERK)
The **MAPK/ERK signaling cascade** is a central driver of cell proliferation and survival in CRC. Activating mutations in **KRAS** or **BRAF** lead to persistent pathway activation, promoting progression from adenoma to carcinoma. KRAS mutations, in particular, represent clinically actionable biomarkers that predict resistance to anti-EGFR therapy.

### PI3K/AKT/mTOR Pathway
The **PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway** regulates cellular growth, metabolism, and survival. Mutations in **PIK3CA** and related components enhance oncogenic signaling and are frequently observed in advanced colorectal tumors, often co-occurring with KRAS mutations.

### TGF-β/SMAD Pathway
The **TGF-β/SMAD signaling pathway** functions as a tumor suppressor during early CRC development by controlling cell cycle arrest and apoptosis. In later stages, mutations in **SMAD4**, **SMAD2**, or **TGFBR2** disrupt this regulatory control and can promote tumor invasion and metastasis.

### DNA Mismatch Repair (MMR) and Microsatellite Instability (MSI)
The **DNA mismatch repair (MMR) pathway**, involving genes such as **MSH2**, **MSH6**, **MLH1**, and **PMS2**, maintains genomic stability by correcting replication errors. Defects in this pathway lead to **microsatellite instability (MSI)**, a hallmark of a significant subset of colorectal cancers with distinct clinical and therapeutic implications.

### Additional Signaling Pathways
Other pathways, including **Notch** and **JAK/STAT**, contribute to colorectal cancer progression by regulating cell fate decisions, immune interactions, and tumor microenvironment dynamics. Although often not primary drivers, these pathways support tumor growth and influence disease behavior.

## Pathway Interactions and Disease Progression

These signaling pathways do not operate in isolation but instead **interact and cross-regulate**, driving the multistep progression from normal colonic epithelium to adenoma, carcinoma, and metastatic disease. Genomic alterations detected through WES provide critical insight into how these pathways are disrupted in colorectal cancer and form the basis for biomarker discovery and precision oncology strategies.
