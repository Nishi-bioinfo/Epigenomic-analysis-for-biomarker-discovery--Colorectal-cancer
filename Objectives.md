1. Investigate Epigenetic Modifications

This objective focuses on identifying and analyzing changes in the epigenome, such as DNA methylation and histone modification patterns that are unique to colorectal cancer. Epigenetic modifications can alter gene expression without changing the DNA sequence, often contributing to cancer development and progression. By mapping these changes, the study aims to reveal new regulatory mechanisms and potential targets for intervention.

2. Identify and Characterize Genes Involved

The goal here is to detect genes whose expression or regulation is significantly altered in colorectal cancer due to epigenetic modifications. This involves integrating genomic data (like mutations or copy number variation) with transcriptomic profiles (mRNA expression levels), ultimately helping to pinpoint genes that drive cancer or may serve as biomarkers for the disease.

3. Map and Analyze Biological Pathways

This step involves linking the identified genes and epigenetic changes to known biological pathways, such as cell cycle regulation, apoptosis, and DNA repair. Pathway analysis enables researchers to understand the broader impact of altered genes and how these disruptions contribute to cancer phenotypes. Discovering affected pathways can also guide the development of targeted therapies.

4. Develop and Validate Biomarkers

Here, the project aims to discover specific RNA molecules or gene signatures that can reliably indicate the presence or progression of colorectal cancer. This involves statistical validation, comparing gene expression in cancerous versus normal tissues, and assessing the predictive power of identified biomarkers. Clinically validated biomarkers could improve early detection and patient stratification.

5.  Provide a Reproducible Methodology

The final objective is to document and share a step-by-step methodological workflow—especially for RNA expression analysis—enabling other researchers to reproduce the analysis or apply it to other datasets. This includes detailing data preprocessing, normalization, statistical analysis, and relevant bioinformatics tools or pipelines used, fostering transparency and reproducibility in cancer research.
