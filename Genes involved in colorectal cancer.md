Here is a list of key genes commonly involved in colorectal cancer:

APC- Frequently the first mutation; causes abnormal cell growth via Wnt pathway disruption.

TP53- Inactivation occurs during transition from adenoma to carcinoma; loss of DNA repair/apoptosis

KRAS- Activating mutations drive adenoma-to-carcinoma transition; promotes cell proliferation

BRAF- Mutations often co-occur with MSI; activate MAPK pathway

PIK3CA- Frequently mutated in advanced disease; leads to activation of PI3K/AKT pathway

SMAD4- Involved later in tumor progression; affects TGF-β signaling

SMAD2- Transduces signals for cell differentiation via TGF-β.

DCC- Functions as a tumor suppressor in cell adhesion

TGFBR2- Transduces TGF-β signals for cell cycle control.

FBXW7- Ubiquitinates proteins to regulate cell division

NRAS- Regulates cell growth through RAS/MAPK signaling.

MSH2- Play central roles in DNA mismatch repair, maintaining genomic stability. 

MSH6- Play central roles in DNA mismatch repair, maintaining genomic stability. 

MLH1- Play central roles in DNA mismatch repair, maintaining genomic stability. 

PMS2- Play central roles in DNA mismatch repair, maintaining genomic stability. 

EPCAM- Play central roles in DNA mismatch repair, maintaining genomic stability. 

 These genes are frequently altered by mutations, deletions, or epigenetic changes, and play critical roles in tumorigenesis, cell cycle regulation, DNA repair, and signaling pathways such as Wnt and TGF-β. The inactivation of tumor suppressors like APC, TP53, SMAD4, and DCC, and the activation of oncogenes like KRAS, BRAF, and PIK3CA, are fundamental genetic events in the development and progression of colorectal cancer.

Summary of genetic progression:

1. Initiation: APC mutations occur early, leading to adenoma formation.

2. Progression: KRAS mutations help push adenomas toward more advanced precancerous lesions (intermediate adenomas). BRAF and PIK3CA mutations may also appear.

3. Malignant transformation: TP53 and SMAD4 inactivation are late events, supporting carcinoma formation and invasiveness.

These driver events are the core of the classic “Vogelstein model” of colorectal tumorigenesis, where accumulation of several mutations is required for full malignancy.
