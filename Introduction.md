Colorectal cancer remains a major global health challenge due to its high prevalence and mortality rates. Recent advances in genomics and epigenomics have revealed that, beyond genetic mutations, epigenetic modifications play a crucial role in tumor initiation and progression. This project aims to systematically analyze colorectal cancer through an integrated approach, focusing on the identification of disease-associated genes, regulatory pathways, and expression signatures using RNA-based methodologies. By studying these components, the project seeks to uncover novel biomarkers that could improve early diagnosis, risk stratification, and the development of targeted therapies for colorectal cancer
